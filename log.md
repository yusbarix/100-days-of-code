**Today's Progress**: Introduction to HTML course. Like commonly-used elements and how to create a web page, how to add elements like links, headings, and images.

**Thoughts:** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally create a web page and also add some elements like links, images and headings.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.
